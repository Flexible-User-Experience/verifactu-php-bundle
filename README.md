VerifactuBundle
===============

VerifactuBundle is a Symfony bundle to deal with Veri*Factu Spanish digital invoicing law. This bundle relies on `josemmo/verifactu-php` library to send your invoices to the AEAT[^aeat] Veri*Factu API.

This bundle also can generate legal QR validation codes as PNG image to include into your printed invoices.

## Disclaimer

This Symfony bundle is provided without a responsible declaration, as it is **not** an Invoicing Computer System ("Sistema Informático de Facturación" or "SIF"[^sif] as known reference in Spain's law).

This is a third-party tool to integrate your SIF[^sif] with the Veri*Factu API to comply with the Spanish state government's anti-fraud law. It is **your responsibility** to audit its code and use it in accordance with the applicable regulations.

For more information, see [Artículo 13 del RD 1007/2023](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2023-24840#a1-5).

Installation
------------

VerifactuBundle requires PHP 8.2 or higher and Symfony 6.4 or higher. Run the following command to install it in your application:

```shell
composer require flexible-ux/verifactu-bundle
```

### Configure the bundle in your `config/packages/flux_verifactu.yaml` file:

```yaml
flux_verifactu:
    aeat_client:
        is_prod_environment: false # only set to true to make real AEAT API calls, be careful here
        pfx_certificate_filepath: '%your_pfx_certificate_filepath%'
        pfx_certificate_password: '%pfx_certificate_password%'
    # SIF (developer) credentials
    computer_system:
        vendor_name: '%your_vendor_name%'
        vendor_nif: '%your_vendor_nif%' # 9 digits (Spanish NIF or CIF)
        name: '%your_name%'
        id: 'ID' # only 2 letters
        version: '%your_version%'
        installation_number: '%your_installation_number%'
        only_supports_verifactu: false # depending on your Invoicing Computer System or ERP
        supports_multiple_taxpayers: false # for now this bundle only supports a single taxpayer, keep it to false
        has_multiple_taxpayers: false # for now this bundle only has a single taxpayer, keep it to false
    # Taxpayer (enterprise who emit the legal invoices) credentials
    fiscal_identifier:
        name: '%your_name%'
        nif: '%your_nif%' # 9 digits (Spanish NIF or CIF)
```

## Usage

### `AeatClientHandler` and `QrCodeHandler` Services

You can inject the `AeatClientHandler` service in your app. Make `sendRegistrationRecord` method calls to send registration records to AEAT API. Your `Invoice` model (or entity) must implement `Flux\VerifactuBundle\Contract\RegistrationRecordInterface`.

For now, you must generate the QR code image at same time, so inject `QrCodeHandler` service too.

```php
use Flux\VerifactuBundle\Handler\AeatClientHandler;
use Flux\VerifactuBundle\Handler\QrCodeHandler;
use josemmo\Verifactu\Models\Responses\ResponseStatus;

class AppTestController
{
    public function test(Invoice $invoice, InvoiceManager $invoiceManager, AeatClientHandler $aeatClientHandler, QrCodeHandler $qrCodeHandler)
    {
//    $transformedInvoice = $this->invoiceManager->transformInvoiceToRegistrationRecordInterface($invoice, $previousInvoice);
        $registrationRecord = $invoiceManager->transformInvoiceToRegistrationRecordInterface($invoice, $invoice->getPreviousInvoice());
        // is up to you to create an `InvoiceManager` (or whatever) to transform your Invoice model into a data value object that implements the `RegistrationRecordInterface` contract.
        // to keep traceability you must include a reference to the previous registered invoice, only can be null for the very first invoice.
        $result = $aeatClientHandler->sendRegistrationRecord($registrationRecord);
        // $result is an `AeatResponseInterface` contract, you must check the response status received and manage it accordingly.
        // you must decide what to do with the response status, and check $result->getStatus() against ResponseStatus::Correct, ResponseStatus::PartiallyCorrect or ResponseStatus::Incorrect possible values 
        // you must read Veri*Factu documentation to handle Invoice integrity and traceability, this is out of the scope of this bundle! 
        $aeatJsonArrayResponse = $aeatClientHandler->getJsonArrayFromAeatResponseDto($result);
        // we recommend you to always store the result array or a JSON serialized version into your Invoice entity
        $invoice->setAeatJsonResponse($aeatJsonArrayResponse);
        // if $result->getStatus() is equals to ResponseStatus::Correct or ResponseStatus::PartiallyCorrect you must persist the `hash` and `hashedAt` values into your Invoice because it is mandatory to attach with the previous invoice traceability information and to keep the current Invoice integrity.
        // this values has been updated into the `$registrationRecord` object during the `sendRegistrationRecord` method call.
        $invoice
            ->setAeatHash($registrationRecord->getHash())
            ->setAeatHashedAt($registrationRecord->getHashedAt())
        ;
        $this->invoiceRepository->update(true);
        // store the changes into your Invoice entity.
        $qrCodePngImage = $qrCodeHandler->buildQrCodeAsPngImageFromRegistrationRecordAndAeatResponseInterfaces($registrationRecord, $result);
        // finally you can get a legal QR code as a PNG image, but keep in mind that for now must be generated at the same moment with successfully responses.
        $qrCodePngImage->saveToFile(sprintf('%s/var/qr_invoice_id_%s.png', $this->assetsManager->getProjectRootDir(), $invoice->getId()));
        // save QR PNG image to disk.
        // read `endroid/qr-code` documentation to handle the image file.
    }
}
